# PETIG - Placeholder English That Isn't Gibberish

***PETIG*** is a simple and effective alternative to the traditional Lorem Ipsum text used in design and publishing. It provides a more readable, coherent block of English text, ensuring that the placeholder content is both functional and meaningful, yet remains neutral and non-specific. 

**PETIG** is designed to mimic the structure of real English writing without conveying any particular message, making it ideal for use in layouts where the focus is on design, rather than content.

It offers a clearer, more engaging option for those who prefer to avoid the randomness of traditional Lorem Ipsum while still maintaining a placeholder that suits the needs of graphic design, web development, and publishing.

The text itself is:

> This is sample content meant to illustrate the final layout and
> design. Please note that this text is only temporary and will soon be
> replaced with actual information. For now, if everything appears
> well-aligned and visually cohesive, this placeholder is successfully
> demonstrating how the real content will fit in.

### WTF is this?!?!
It's a filler text that isn't random or nonsensical.
As Wikipedia puts it: Filler text (also placeholder text or dummy text) is text that shares some characteristics of a real written text, but is random or otherwise generated. It may be used to display a sample of fonts, generate text for testing, or to spoof an e-mail spam filter. The process of using filler text is sometimes called greeking, although the text itself may be nonsense, or largely Latin, as in Lorem ipsum.

## Thanks
You totally don't need to support me and my random annoyance at seeing fellow web designers using Lorem Ipsum everywhere, but if you found a random-ass paragraph I wrote and a web tool that literally just spams a text box useful then donations are totally appreciated!
